To build an interactive AI chatbot, we first selected the pre-trained DialoGPT-medium model from Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library for generating human-like responses. We set up the environment by installing necessary libraries such as transformers, torch, and streamlit. For backend development, we wrote Python code to load the model, process user inputs, generate appropriate responses, and maintain chat history. In the frontend development, we designed a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to facilitate real-time interaction with the chatbot. Finally, we integrated the backend and frontend components to create a seamless and interactive chat application.
